            Clauses 7.2 and 7.3 have effect together as if they consisted of
            separate provisions, each being severable from the other. Each
            separate provision results from combining each undertaking in clause
            7.2, with each period in clause 7.3 If any of those separate
            provisions is invalid or unenforceable for any reason, the
            invalidity or unenforceability does not affect the validity or
            enforceability of any of the other separate provisions or other
            combinations of the separate provisions of clauses 7.2 and 7.3.
