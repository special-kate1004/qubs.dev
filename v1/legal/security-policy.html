                            environmental hazards, such as fire, flooding, power outages, and temperature fluctuations.
                        </p>


                        <p><b>Network Security</b> refers to the measures taken to protect the infrastructure and
                            systems that transmit, process, and store Your Content against unauthorized access, data

                    </ol>



                    <h4>Our Obligations</h4>

                    <p>Without limiting any provision of the QUBS Terms of Service, we will implement reasonable and
                        appropriate measures designed to help you secure Your Content against accidental or unlawful
                        loss, access or disclosure.</p>


                    <h4>Your Obligations</h4>


                    <p> Our documentation may specify restrictions on how the Services may be configured. You agree to
                        comply with any such restrictions or specifications.</p>

                    <p>QUBS access credentials and private keys generated by the Services are for your internal use
                        only. You may not sell, transfer, or sublicense them to any other entity or person, except that
                        you may disclose your private key to your agents and subcontractors performing work on your
                        behalf.</p>
 
 
                    <h4>Reporting Security Vulnerabilities</h4>

                    <p>If you discover a potential security vulnerability, we strongly prefer that you notify us in
                        private. Publicly disclosing a security vulnerability without informing us first puts the
                        community at risk. When you notify us of a potential problem, we will work with you to make sure
                        we understand the scope and cause of the issue. Please report security vulnerabilities to
                        security@qubs.com or use our contact form. Thank you!</p>




                    <h4>Data Center Security</h4>

                    <p>QUBS runs on the Amazon Web Services global infrastructure platform.</p>

                    <p> AWS publishes an <a
                            href="https://d0.awsstatic.com/whitepapers/Security/AWS_Security_Whitepaper.pdf">"Overview
                            of Security Processes"</a> whitepaper that serves as the reference
                        material for this section. SOC 2 reports are available directly from AWS upon request.
                    </p>

                    <p> Please note that while we rely on AWS for data center security and take precautions to protect
                        your data, we cannot guarantee the absolute security of the information stored in AWS data
                        centers.
                    </p>

                        <li>
                            <h4>Compliance</h4>
                            <p>AWS computing environments are continuously audited, with certifications from
                                accreditation bodies across geographies and verticals, including ISO 27001, FedRAMP,
                                DoD CSM, and PCI DSS. Additionally AWS also has assurance programs that provide
                                templates and control mappings to help customers establish the compliance of their
                                environments running on AWS against 20+ standards, including the HIPAA, CESG (UK),
                                and Singapore Multi-tier Cloud Security (MTCS) standards.</p>
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            <h4>Physical Security</h4>
                            <p>AWS data centers are housed in nondescript facilities. Physical access is strictly
                                controlled both at the perimeter and at building ingress points by professional security
                                staff utilizing video surveillance, intrusion detection systems, and other electronic
                                means. Authorized staff must pass two-factor authentication a minimum of two times to
                                access data center floors. All visitors and contractors are required to present
                                identification and are signed in and continually escorted by authorized staff.</p>

                    <h4>QUBS Network Security</h4>

                    <p> Please note that while we implement various network security measures and rely on AWS for
                        certain aspects of network security, we cannot guarantee the absolute security of the
                        information transmitted over the network. We encourage you to take appropriate precautions to
                        protect your data and information.
                    </p>

                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            <h4>Firewalls</h4>
                            <p>All public-facing EC2 instances use inbound Security Group rules configured in deny-all
                                mode. Ports are opened as necessary for: administrative SSH access, QUBS Deploy SSH
                                Portal Access. </p>
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            <h4>Port Scanning</h4>
                            <p>AWS monitors and stops unauthorized port scanning. All QUBS hosts run strict firewalls,
                                port scanning is generally
                                ineffective. </p>
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            <h4>Spoofing & Sniffing</h4>
                            <p>The AWS network prohibits a host from sending traffic with a source IP or MAC address
                                other than its own. The AWS hypervisor will also not deliver any traffic to a host the
                                traffic is not addressed to, meaning even an instance running in promiscuous mode will
                                not receive or be able to "sniff" traffic intended for other hosts. </p>
                        </li>


                    </ol>



                    <h4> Data Encryption</h4>
                    <p> To ensure the protection of sensitive data, we employ encryption both in transit and at rest:
                    </p>

                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            <h4>In Transit</h4>
                            <p>All data transmitted between our servers and customers is secured using SSL/TLS
                                encryption. This helps protect the confidentiality and integrity of data as it travels
                                over the
                                internet. </p>
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            <h4>At Rest</h4>
                            <p>Customer data stored on our servers is encrypted using industry-standard AES-256
                                encryption. This provides an additional layer of security for sensitive information,
                                even if
                                unauthorized access to our systems occurs. </p>
                        </li>
                    </ol>




                    <h4>Business Continuity</h4>

                    <p> Please note that while we implement business continuity measures and rely on AWS for certain
                        aspects of our infrastructure, we cannot guarantee absolute protection against data loss or
                        system failures. We encourage you to take appropriate precautions and consult with legal
                        professionals for comprehensive protection.

                                QUBS point-in-time recovery (PITR) provides automatic backups of your RIS patient
                                data. The retention period is a fixed 35 days (5 calendar weeks).
                            </p>
                            <p>Patient DICOM images are versioned to prevent accidental deletions and to protect
                                from viruses. Older version are deleted after 30 days</p>

                            <p>Patient scanned documents and attachments are versioned to prevent accidental
                                deletions and to protect from viruses. Older version are deleted after 30 days</p>


                            <p> In the event a user requests the recovery of accidentally deleted data from backups, the
                                labor costs associated with the recovery process will be passed on to the user. The user
                                will be informed of the estimated costs and must agree to them before the recovery
                                process is initiated.
