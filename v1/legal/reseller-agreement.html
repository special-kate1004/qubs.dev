                                    each being severable from the other. Each separate provision results from combining

                                    separate provisions is invalid or unenforceable for any reason, the invalidity or
                                    unenforceability does not affect the validity or enforceability of any of the other
                                    separate provisions or other combinations of the separate provisions of clauses 7.2
